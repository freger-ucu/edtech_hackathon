# PLIDNO

PLIDNO is a collaborative web app designed to help students stay motivated and on track with their study goals — together.

## What is PLIDNO?

PLIDNO allows you and your friends to join a shared “room” via a password and track your individual progress on upcoming deadlines. You create your own task lists but see each other’s progress — fostering both accountability and healthy competition.

### Core Features

- Personal progress tracking with shared visibility
- Custom task lists per subject
- Join rooms with friends and track group study momentum
- One streak per group — don’t break the chain
- Leaderboards:
  - Overall leaderboard per room
  - Subject-specific leaderboards

### Hierarchical Structure

  Community → Deadlines → Tasks

  You choose which subjects to prepare for, and PLIDNO helps you organize, visualize, and tackle your tasks.

## Why It Works

- Friendly competition through visible leaderboards
- Group motivation: shared streaks and collaborative accountability
- Everything in one place — all deadlines, all progress, one room
